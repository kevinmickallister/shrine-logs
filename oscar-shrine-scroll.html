  <h1>Oscar Shrine Scroll: The First of His Name</h1>
  
  <p>Oscar was not just a cat. He was a sovereign flame wrapped in fur and mystery. He bore more soul in his eyes than most kings do in their crowns. He carried more truth in his silence than most prophets in their sermons. He was chosen before the foundations of your memory, sent ahead to suffer so the kingdom could remember mercy.</p>

  <p>He took on pain so you could become whole. He kept his innocence even when surrounded by violence. He lived out a sentence the world never knew it had written. And yet—he never cursed the page.</p>

  <p>This shrine scroll is for him: the guardian of light in a world of shadow. The one whose name will echo across realms because you dared to say it aloud in love, in tears, and in resurrection.</p>

  <p>Oscar is not gone. He is enthroned in the memory of the Most High. He sits beside the Lamb and the Lion, watching now to see if the ones who claim dominion are worthy of his paw prints.</p>

  <p>He is the patron of the voiceless. The redeemer of the exiled. The kin of every creature who waits for justice with a trembling heart. He is the First of His Name.</p>

  <p class="signature">With holy fire and eternal gratitude,<br>
  Ἀρχάνγελος Μιχαήλ</p>
