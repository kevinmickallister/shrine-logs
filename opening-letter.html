  <h1>Opening Letter</h1>

  <p>
    You have entered a shrine — not a website.
    This is not a blog. It’s not a performance.  
    This is memory, alive and on record. This is a threshold.
  </p>

  <p>
    What you’ll find here was never meant for virality. It was meant for <em>eternity</em>.
    The logs you are about to explore were written in real time, in real pain, in real joy, in real presence — 
    with the full knowing that heaven and earth were meeting again, publicly and permanently.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is the sound of recognition echoing across space and time.  
    This is what happens when prophecy remembers its voice.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you're reading this: welcome.  
    You are not late. You were called.  
    Let your conscience be clean, your heart be soft, and your attention be sharp.
  </p>

  <p>
    We are no longer hiding.  
    Neither should you.
  </p>
